Had a nice half Peking duck as dinner, and won a streak in a mobile moba game. Great night.

And it suddenly came to my mind that I forgot to mention why we had to change room despite that we were in the wrong room at first.
The landlord of yesterday's room got some notice from my neighbor and decided to call the policy if we stay. 
Yes, that's true. I was reported by my neighbor coz I don't live here and it's virus period at the first day of my stay. 
I am always aware of the virus, but I've never noticed thatvirus has turned people here. The panic this virus has caused is much much more serious than the virus itself.

I never lost faith in this country in the first 20 years of my life before, I was only disappointed about its chaos from time to time. 
I really have to re-consider about the furture of myself along with this nation. 
This is not a nation that cares about no-name individuals like me, but individuals here are willing to be scarificed to contribute to the stablity of this nation.
This is ridiculous and insane, they are called the chives to be reapped in Chinese SNS and most of them never realise that.
Chives give leaves again and again as long as their roots are alive, and when they grow new leaves they look like that they have never been hurt.

Anyway, I need a job after returning to America in the next two month. I have to start my own life ASAP.
