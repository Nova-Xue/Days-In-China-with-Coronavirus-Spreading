One lie to make up the story leads to more lies than I ever expected.

I had to tell those volunteers of this community that I had left the second hotel which I actually stayed and would stay until next month.
And they want my destination address for my fake leave. I gave them the address of a relative in Shenyang. And worse things happened after that.

This morning I got a phone call from another community, which is from the community of the fake destination I guess.
They asked me again our ID, fligh # and so on, which really upsets me now.

I gave my understanding, but I recieved no respect and privacy.

We decided to stop answering any phone calls from Shenyang from now on.

Our landlord told us to lie about our leave for peace, not for disturbance.

Fk all this shit.
